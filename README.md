# Chat App

## Introduction:
An Chatting App made to Connect to an Local Server hosted on the Connected Local Wifi.

## Safety:
Encryption: Im not an Encryption Pro, but usually the Server sends the Encryption Key to the Chat app. But for now everyone has the same Key which is not very safe.
Networking: Be safe and only Open this on Networks you trust since my code can be bad and i just made this for fun, i tried to look out tho for any Exploitable but i cant garantee anything.

## How To Build:
1. Download Visual Studio 2022, and the Windows SDK since this is only for Windows Users only!.
2. Then Download the Basic C++ Components in Visual Studio and then Build with C++ 20

## How To Host:
Build and Run the certain Server and if you want to share with others change the predefined Mac address in my Code. \
